/*Prisma Config when using it with NextJS

Each time the server is refreshed, a new prisma cleient is generated, which is not needed, but rather 
have 1 prisma client for the entire application. 

In development, the command next dev clears Node.js cache on run. This in turn initializes a new PrismaClient 
instance each time due to hot reloading that creates a connection to the database. This can quickly exhaust 
the database connections as each PrismaClient instance holds its own connection pool.

Solution:
The solution in this case is to instantiate a single instance PrismaClient and save it on the global object. 
Then we keep a check to only instantiate PrismaClient if it's not on the global object otherwise use the same 
instance again if already present to prevent instantiating extra PrismaClient instances.
